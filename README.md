### ME 133a Final Project - Atlas Chef

Final project for Caltech ME/CS 133a Robotics course where we evaluate the performance of the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot cutting with the right hand and reaching to grab an item on a neighboring shelf with the left. We approach this problem in two ways: First, we define the cutting motion of the right arm as the primary task and the left hand as the secondary task. Second, we define both the right and left hand tasks as primary tasks. We describe our results including the tradeoffs between both approaches in our final report and video.
